## Installing Aseen

Open the `Aseen Setup.exe` file that you just downloaded.

You may get a warning from Windows when you try to open the installer. Aseen is open source and does not have any malicious intent. If you feel comfortable installing Aseen, click the dropdown below and follow the images
